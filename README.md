# 🛠️ Backend Planner

## 📚 Project Overview

**Backend Planner** is a modular, developer-friendly tool designed to streamline backend architecture planning. It enables developers to register entities and actions, automatically generating:

- AI-ready backend prompts (for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic)
- Visual API diagrams (.drawio files compatible with diagrams.net)
- Structured outputs that accelerate backend system development

With Backend Planner, you can focus on clean architecture and scalability from day one, saving countless hours of manual design work.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive visual interface)
- **Standard Python libraries**:
  - `json`
  - `xml.etree.ElementTree`
  - `os`
- **Draw.io (diagrams.net)** compatible XML generation

## 📦 Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backendplanner.git
cd backendplanner
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🌟 How to Start

To launch the Backend Planner, simply run:

```bash
python run_backend_planner.py
```

From the launcher menu, you can:

- Run the Terminal CLI
- Run the Streamlit Visual App
- Generate the AI backend prompt
- Generate the Draw.io API diagram

All outputs will be saved automatically inside the `/outputs/` directory.

---

## 📋 Usage Instructions

- Use the Terminal CLI or the Streamlit web app to:
  - Register new entities and define actions (CRUD or custom)
  - List and manage all registered entities
  - Save entities for later use
  - Generate a backend prompt text ready for AI tools
  - Generate a Draw.io visual diagram for your backend structure

- Outputs generated:
  - `entities.json` — stored entities
  - `backend_prompt.txt` — AI backend generation prompt
  - `api_diagram.drawio` — visual API diagram
